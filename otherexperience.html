		<!-- Intorduction to Penn State Experience -->
		<p class = "psuExp" id="mainPSU">I have my first Bachelors of Sicence in Geography (GIS) from The Pennsylvania State University. Located in 
		University Park, PA. I found Geography via the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. I took my first Geographic information Systems (GIS)
		class in the spring of my first year at Penn State and I was hooked from then on. I throughly enjoyed my accademic carrer at Penn State. I've listed my 
		relevant coursework below, but some of my favorite courses were my cartography courses and my GIS Programming course. I unfortunatley
		didn't find programming until my last year at Penn State. I loved the critical thinking and creativity it prompted, it sparked my interest
		in computer science and I may not be in this Oregon State Program if I had not taken that course.</p>

		<p class="psuExp" id="otherPSU">Beyond my Penn State coursework, I also attended the Association of American Geographers Annual Meeting in 2013 and 2014.
		I presented work from my classes at both. I also intered at the wetlands center, Riparia, for two summers as a GIS intern. While also being a teaching
		intern for the Cartography course and a course for geology students learning GIS</p>
