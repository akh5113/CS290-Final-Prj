	<p class = "osu-intro" id = "OSUintro">I would reccommend the Oregon State Postbaccalaureate program
	to anyone interested in pursuing a Computer Science degree. This is my first time taking a completely
	online course and it has gone better than I could have ever imagined. It takes a few weeks to get into a groove,
	but between the support from the online community of students, and the high-quality content of the courses, there
	are many ways to succeed. </p>
